- **Seamless navigation** without needing to manually switch to Chat view first
- **Consistent behavior** across all application views

### **🔄 Smart View Switching**

---

## 🛠️ **Technical Implementation**

### **Modified Methods**

#### **1. Enhanced `load_chat_session()` Method**
```python
def load_chat_session(self, session_id: int):
    """Load an existing chat session and redirect to chat view"""
    # ... existing chat loading logic ...
    
    # NEW: Redirect to chat view regardless of current page
    st.session_state.current_view = 'chat'
    
    # Enhanced audit logging
    details = f"Loaded chat session with {len(messages)} messages and redirected to chat view"
```

**Key Changes:**
- ✅ **Added automatic view switching** with `st.session_state.current_view = 'chat'`
- ✅ **Enhanced audit logging** to track navigation redirections
- ✅ **Preserved all existing functionality** (message loading, session tracking)

#### **2. Enhanced `start_new_chat()` Method**
```python
def start_new_chat(self):
    """Start a new chat session and redirect to chat view"""
    # ... existing new chat logic ...
    
    # NEW: Redirect to chat view regardless of current page
    st.session_state.current_view = 'chat'
    
    # Enhanced audit logging
    details = "New chat session created and redirected to chat view"
```

**Key Changes:**
- ✅ **Added automatic view switching** for new chat creation
- ✅ **Consistent behavior** with chat selection
- ✅ **Enhanced audit tracking** for new chat creation
