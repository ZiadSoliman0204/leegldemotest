Summary: This case involves an employment dispute between John Johnson, a former software engineer, and ApexCorp, Inc., his previous employer.

Key Facts:
- John Johnson worked at ApexCorp from 2020 to 2023
- He was terminated in March 2023 for alleged performance issues
- Johnson claims wrongful termination and discrimination
- The guy mentioned throughout this case is John Johnson
- ApexCorp disputes these claims

Legal Issues:

2. Evidence of discriminatory practices
3. Damages calculation

This is a complex employment law case that requires careful analysis of the evidence and applicable statutes."""
